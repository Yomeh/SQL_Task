# SQL_Task
# TASK 1
# Introduction
SQL(Structured Query Language) is a type of language used to manage relational databases. It is used to query a collection of organized and structured data. In this session, I understood the various types of databases such as Relational and Non-Relational, emphasis was placed more on the relational databases as it would be the working database used. To use this database, the SQL Server Management System tool would be the working environment.

The first session of the SQL kicked off with introductions to what SQL is, followed by learning about databases, creating databases, creating and altering tables to adding constraints within the database.
